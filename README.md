# Case-Study-1

The purpose of this project is to make comparisons of Craft Beers and Breweries in the United States.
Some of these comparisons include:

  -Count of Breweries in each state
  
  -The median ABV and IBU levels of beers in each state
  
  -Median ABV and IBU levels of beers in each census region
  
  -Correlation of IBU and ABV levels of Craft beers
  
  -Most popular craft beer style in each state
  
  -Beer with the highest ABV level and beer with the highest IBU level
  
  
This project also includes code that allows machine learning models to help classify a beer style based off of ABV and IBU data.
Ultimately the KNN model was selected to represent our findings as it provided the highest accuracy, but both KNN and Naive Bayes Models were run to test the data.
